To query with raw Cypher queries you can use the built in `find` and `findAll` methods:

[source,groovy]
----
def club = Club.find("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", 'FC Bayern Muenchen')
def clubs = Club.findAll("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", 'FC Bayern Muenchen')
----

Note that the first returned item should be the node itself. To execute cypher queries and work with the raw results use `executeCypher`:

[source,groovy]
----
Result result = Club.executeCypher("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", ['FC Bayern Muenchen'])
----

Or alternatively you can use `executeQuery` which will return a list of results:

[source,groovy]
----
List<Node> nodes = Club.executeQuery("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", ['FC Bayern Muenchen'])
----

When working with raw results, you can convert any `org.neo4j.driver.types.Node` into a domain instance using the `as` keyword:

[source,groovy]
----
Node myNode = ...
 Club club = myNode as Club
----

TIP: This also works for `Relationship` and `Path` types

You can also convert any https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/4.0/org/neo4j/driver/Result.html[org.neo4j.driver.Result] instance to a list of domain classes:

[source,groovy]
----
Result result = ...
List<Club> clubs = result.toList(Club)
----
